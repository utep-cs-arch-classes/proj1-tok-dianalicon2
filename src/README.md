Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
## Getting Started
To run the program, type in the command "make main" while in the src
directory. Then type "./test". Now you are redy to start using the tokenizer.
## Cleaning Up
When using the tokenizer, you can clean up the files at any time. "make clean"
will get rid of any unused or unnecessry files created in the process.
## Using the Tokenizer
You will first be asked to enter srings. At any time during this procces, you
can type q followed by the enter key to quit this process and go to the next
step(viewing history)

Then, after q is entered, you will be asked to either 1)view all history or 2)search
by index(the list indices start at 1). Enter your choice as the corresponding
digit.

If you chose 2)search by index, enter ! followed by the index you wish to
see.
